# Spectral Phasor Web Approach

## What this is

This is made to adapt the [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov) plugins made by [Spechron.com](http://spechron/com) so that they are usable as web applications. This way, the user does not have to actually install ImageJ.

## Installation

In the /Config folder, add a text file called jarfile.txt which contains the path to the jar file created from compiling the java portion - the plugin itself.
